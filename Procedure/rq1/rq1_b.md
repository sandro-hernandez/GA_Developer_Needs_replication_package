### Step 2: **Establishing the Baseline**

The **baseline** is a reference point that allows us to compare the performance of GitHub Actions with other CI/CD tools to understand how it ranks in terms of popularity, difficulty, and response time.

#### **1. Identification of Key Metrics**
The metrics we are analyzing are:
- **Number of Questions**: Indicates the popularity of the tool, measured by the number of questions posted on Stack Overflow each year.
- **Percentage of Questions with No Accepted Answer (%nAA)**: Measures the difficulty of the questions associated with the tool, determined by the percentage of questions that do not receive an accepted answer.
- **Response Time (RT)**: Measures the community's efficiency in answering questions, calculated as the average time it takes to receive an accepted answer.

#### **2. Data Collection for Comparative Tools**
To establish a baseline, we collected data on these metrics for other CI/CD tools similar to GitHub Actions. In this case, we considered popular tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, Travis CI, and CircleCI. These data were collected over the same period (2019-2024) to ensure a fair comparison.

| Tool           | Average Number of Questions (2019-2024) | Average %nAA (2019-2024) | Average RT (Days) (2019-2024) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Jenkins        | 866.67                                  | 20.0%                    | 2.6                           |
| GitLab CI      | 958.33                                  | 22.0%                    | 2.8                           |
| Azure DevOps   | 1050.00                                 | 18.0%                    | 2.65                          |
| Travis CI      | 700.00                                  | 28.5%                    | 3.4                           |
| CircleCI       | 775.00                                  | 27.3%                    | 3.1                           |

#### **3. Calculating the Baseline**
The baseline is calculated by taking the average of the metrics from the comparative tools listed above. This average will serve as a reference point to evaluate whether GitHub Actions performs better, equal, or worse than the average of these tools.

| Metric                          | Baseline (Average of Comparative Tools) |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Average Number of Questions** | 869.00                                  |
| **Average %nAA**                | 23.2%                                   |
| **Average RT (Days)**           | 2.93                                    |

- **Average Number of Questions (869.00)**: This figure represents the average number of questions posted annually on Stack Overflow for the comparative CI/CD tools.
- **%nAA (23.2%)**: This percentage represents the average proportion of questions that do not receive an accepted answer for the comparative tools.
- **RT (2.93 days)**: This is the average time it takes for a question to receive an accepted answer across the considered CI/CD tools.

#### **4. Purpose of the Baseline**
The baseline provides a clear reference:
- **If GitHub Actions exceeds the baseline in the number of questions**, we can infer that it is more popular than the comparative tools.
- **If GitHub Actions' %nAA is higher than the baseline**, it suggests that questions about GitHub Actions are more challenging to answer.
- **If GitHub Actions' RT is higher than the baseline**, it indicates that questions take longer to be answered compared to other tools.

### Step 3: **Comparison of Metrics with the Baseline and Classification**

GitHub Actions' metrics are compared with the baseline to determine whether its performance is **high**, **moderate**, or **low** relative to other tools:

1. **High**: If GitHub Actions' metrics are significantly higher than the baseline.
2. **Moderate**: If GitHub Actions' metrics are close to the baseline.
3. **Low**: If GitHub Actions' metrics are significantly lower than the baseline.

| Metric                          | GitHub Actions | Baseline (Average of Comparative Tools) | Classification                   |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Average Number of Questions     | 1183.33        | 869.00                                  | High Popularity (More questions than the baseline)               |
| Average %nAA                    | 24.5%          | 23.2%                                   | Moderate Difficulty (Slightly higher than the baseline)          |
| Average RT (Days)               | 3.2            | 2.93                                    | Moderate Response Time (Slightly longer than the baseline)       |

### Step 4: **Interpretation of Results**

In this step, we delve deeper into how GitHub Actions ranks relative to the baseline, evaluating its performance in terms of popularity, difficulty, and response time.

1. **Popularity (Number of Questions)**
   - **Result:** GitHub Actions shows an average of 1183.33 questions per year, which is significantly higher than the baseline of 869.00 questions for other CI/CD tools.
   - **Interpretation:** This high volume of questions indicates that GitHub Actions is a very popular tool within the developer community. Its popularity could be attributed to several factors, such as its native integration with GitHub, the flexibility it offers for automating workflows, and the growing support from the community and third parties.
   - **Implication:** Such high popularity may also imply that more developers are adopting GitHub Actions for their projects, which could lead to increased demand for support and documentation, especially for more complex use cases.

2. **Difficulty (%nAA)**
   - **Result:** The percentage of questions with no accepted answer (%nAA) for GitHub Actions is 24.5%, which is slightly higher than the baseline of 23.2%.
   - **Interpretation:** Although this increase is not extremely high, it suggests that GitHub Actions users may be facing moderately more difficult challenges compared to other CI/CD tools. This could be related to the diversity of use cases that GitHub Actions supports or the need to integrate various technologies and external services.
   - **Implication:** A higher %nAA could indicate that some issues encountered by users are complex and do not always find quick or easy solutions in the community. This might require additional effort to improve documentation, practical guides, or even create specific learning resources for the most common problems.

3. **Response Time (RT)**
   - **Result:** The average response time (RT) for questions about GitHub Actions is 3.2 days, which is slightly higher than the baseline of 2.93 days.
   - **Interpretation:** A longer response time suggests that questions related to GitHub Actions may be more complicated to resolve, or that the community may take longer to provide solutions due to the specific nature of the questions.
   - **Implication:** The complexity of some questions or the lack of available experts to respond quickly could be contributing to this longer response time. This highlights the need to strengthen the community of users and experts, possibly by encouraging participation in forums or real-time Q&A events.

### Step 5: **Documentation and Communication of Results**

Based on the previous interpretations, we formulate the following recommendations:

1. **Improve Documentation and Learning Resources**
   - **Recommendation:** Given the high volume of questions and the moderate difficulty users face, it is crucial to continue improving the official GitHub Actions documentation. This includes creating more practical examples, step-by-step guides, and tutorial videos that cover both basic concepts and more advanced use cases.
   - **Justification:** Better documentation can reduce the %nAA by making it easier for users to find solutions on their own, and it could also speed up response times by clarifying common doubts before they become open questions in the community.

2. **Encourage Community Participation and Collaboration**
   - **Recommendation:** Encourage more experienced users to actively participate in forums and Stack Overflow communities, whether through reward programs or recognition within the platform.
   - **Justification:** Greater participation from experts can help reduce both %nAA and RT by ensuring that difficult questions are addressed more quickly and with high-quality answers.

3. **Develop Support and Diagnostic Tools**
   - **Recommendation:** Consider creating automated support and diagnostic tools within GitHub Actions that can guide users through complex configurations or identify common issues before they need to ask in public forums.
   - **Justification:** These tools could be especially useful in reducing perceived complexity (reflected in the %nAA) and improving the user experience by offering proactive solutions.

4. **Conduct Continuous Analysis**
   - **Recommendation:** Implement continuous monitoring of GitHub Actions' performance in terms of these metrics, regularly comparing it with other CI/CD tools to identify trends and areas that need attention.
   - **Justification:** Continuous analysis will allow development teams and the community to adjust their support and development strategies, ensuring that GitHub Actions continues to improve and maintains its competitive position.
